# Java-XTS-AES

Java XTS-AES engine built over [BouncyCastle](http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html). Created as a requirement for [InflatableDonkey](https://github.com/horrorho/InflatableDonkey). Only byte aligned data units are supported.
    
Please refer to the unit tests for usage examples.
    
NB. Although it satisfies all of the supplied IEEE P1619 test vectors, I only have access to the DRAFT proposals and not the final document. In addition I make no claims to NIST conformance. Use at your own risk.
